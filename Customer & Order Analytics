-- In the following queries, I'm utilizing a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

SELECT DISTINCT Product, Price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
ORDER BY Price
LIMIT 1;

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

SELECT Product
,ROUND(SUM(Quantity) * price, 2) AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product;

SELECT Product
,SUM(Quantity)
,SUM(Quantity) * price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
AND LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product;

SELECT Count(DISTINCT Cust.acctnum)             AS cust_count, 
       Round(Avg(quantity * price), 2) AS avg_amt_spent 
FROM   bit_db.febsales Feb 
       JOIN bit_db.customers Cust 
         ON FEB.orderid = Cust.order_id 
WHERE  Feb.quantity > 2 
       AND Length(orderid) = 6 
       AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
