-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle, created a table to insert the data into, and analyzed the data by asking the questions listed below.

-- Created the table using the following:
CREATE TABLE bit_db.spotifydata 
  ( 
     id               INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
     artist_name      VARCHAR NOT NULL, 
     track_name       VARCHAR NOT NULL, 
     track_id         VARCHAR NOT NULL, 
     popularity       INTEGER NOT NULL, 
     danceability     DECIMAL(4, 3) NOT NULL, 
     energy           DECIMAL(4, 3) NOT NULL, 
     song_key         INTEGER NOT NULL, 
     loudness         DECIMAL(5, 3) NOT NULL, 
     song_mode        INTEGER NOT NULL, 
     speechiness      DECIMAL(5, 4) NOT NULL, 
     acousticness     DECIMAL(6, 5) NOT NULL, 
     instrumentalness DECIMAL(8, 7) NOT NULL, 
     liveness         DECIMAL(5, 4) NOT NULL, 
     valence          DECIMAL(4, 3) NOT NULL, 
     tempo            DECIMAL(6, 3) NOT NULL, 
     duration_ms      INTEGER NOT NULL, 
     time_signature   INTEGER NOT NULL 
  ) 

-- Inserted the spotify_top50_2021.csv file downloaded from Kaggle into the table using SQLiteStudio.


-- What songs would the ultimate workout playlist consist of?

-- Who is the best artist to hear live?

-- What songs would be the most likely to reduce anxiety and uplift mood?

-- What songs are similar to the top three songs with the highest danceability and energy?
